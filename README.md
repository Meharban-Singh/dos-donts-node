dos-donts-node
======

This is the dos-donts project with node.js.

Somethings are unsaid and common for the people of that country, but not so much for the visitors (like how to greet, some things are restricted in the Country too, while some are not just culturally acceptable). This webapp aims to tell users what to do and what not to do when visiting a country.
